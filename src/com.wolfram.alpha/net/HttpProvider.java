    // can change state of all uses of this provider in other threads. Better to have a factory that
    // creates providers with certain params (like useragent), and these are not singletons. Thus if you
    // want to change useragent in a session, or have multiple different types of transactions, you just
    // create different providers. MAYBE this is OK, Have setters for all params here.
