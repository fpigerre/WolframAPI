    // and replaces the file with a specially-formatted one. This wouldn't happen for other API clients. This URL is what is
    // returned by getURL(). The second form for source info is the HTML page that you would see on the website
    // (it has a banner that looks like the rest of the website). Clients might want to direct users to that page instead,
